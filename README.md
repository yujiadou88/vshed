# Viral Shedding and Clinical Illness (Subproject of the Hong Kong NPI Study)

This repository contains the data and analysis scripts for the "viral shedding and clinical illness" subproject of the [Hong Kong NPI Study](https://github.com/yujiadou88/HK_NPI_Study/blob/main/README.md).

In acute influenza virus infections most viral shedding occurs within a few days of illness onset, and the degree of viral shedding correlates with symptoms and tympanic temperature.

Results described in [Lau et al. (2010, JID](http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/652241 "full text of Lau et al., 2010, JID")) are reproduced in the following scripts which can be run in [R](http://www.r-project.org "R statistical software homepage"):

-   [scripts](vshed_scripts/JID_dataframe.r) to reformat the raw data (used in some of the other scripts here)

-   [Table 1](vshed_scripts/Table_1.r)

-   [Figure 1](vshed_scripts/Figure_1.r)

-   [Figure 2](vshed_scripts/Figure_2.r)

-   [Figure 3](vshed_scripts/WinBUGS.zip) *(downloadable zip file with WinBUGS scripts - these require the R package `R2WinBUGS` and setup instructions [available here](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/bugsR/))*

-   [Appendix Table 1](vshed_scripts/Appendix_Table_1.r)

-   [Appendix Figure 1](vshed_scripts/Appendix_Figure_1.r)

-   [Appendix Figure 2](vshed_scripts/Appendix_Figure_2.r)
