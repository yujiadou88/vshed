<h3><a name="overview">1. Study overview</a></h3>

<p>There is a serious deficit in the evidence base on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions
can reduce the spread of influenza. We implemented a study of whether face masks and hand 
hygiene can reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members.</p>

<p>In 2007 (pilot) and 2008 (main study) we recruited subjects presenting to outpatient 
clinics (in both the private and public sectors across Hong Kong) with 
influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index 
case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, or in some clinics based on a clinical 
definition alone, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) 
hand hygiene or 3) hand hygiene plus surgical face masks (the 3rd arm was surgical face 
masks in the pilot study). We aimed to implement the interventions at an initial home
visit within 36 hours of recruitment, and evaluate subsequent infections by self-reported 
daily symptom diaries and home visits after 3 and 6 days
(and additionally after 9 days in the pilot study). Nose and throat swabs were collected 
from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral 
culture and or RT-PCR. The primary outcome measure was laboratory-confirmed influenza infection
in a household contact by viral culture (pilot) or RT-PCR (main); the secondary outcome was 
clinically diagnosed influenza by self-reported symptoms. We evaluated adherence by self-report and by 
measuring the number of surgical masks used and weighing the amount of soap/hand rub used.

<p>Full details of our study design are available in our 
<a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002101" title="HK NPI study protocol">study protocol</a> 
(the link is to version GML001.5, 10-Dec-2007).</p>

<p>We are often asked why we chose to recruit index cases presenting with ILI and observe
their households for a week (called a 'case-ascertained' design),
rather than starting with a cohort of uninfected households and 
following them over an influenza season. Much greater resources might be required for the
latter study, given the low annual attack rate of influenza. 
A weakness of our chosen study design is the delay between index case symptom onset (or more
precisely the onset of index case infectiousness) and application of the intervention, and 
any intervention effects we observe would likely be attenuated due to this delay. We are
actively working on models which can estimate intervention effects allowing for delays.</p>

<h3><a name="pilot">3. Pilot findings</a></h3>

<p>The primary findings from the 2007 pilot study were published by

In brief, the pilot study achieved its aim of confirming the feasibility of the main study design, and provided some information about the
secondary attack ratios. We found no evidence of intervention effects although with only 122 households our pilot study was underpowered to
detect even fairly large differences between arms, and adherence to the hand hygiene and face mask interventions was variable.</p>

<h3><a name="serial">4. Serial interval</a></h3>

<p>We investigated the clinical onset serial intervals in our pilot study,
adjusting for our 'case-ascertained' study design, and our results are published
in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e31819d1092"
title="full text of Cowling et al., 2009, Epidemiology">Cowling et al. (2009, Epidemiology)</a>. 
We used symptom onset times from 14 pairs of infector/infectee in the NPI pilot
study to estimate the clinical serial interval of human influenza in households
to have mean 3.6 days (95% confidence interval: 2.9, 4.3 days),
with standard deviation 1.6 days. This is slightly longer than some previous estimates.</p>

<p>Our finding of a mean serial interval of 3.6 days suggests that the average
time from symptom onset in the index case to secondary infection in the household
setting may be around 2 days, assuming that the average time from secondary
infection to secondary onset (the incubation period) is around 1.5 days 
(<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/463858"
title="full text of Moser et al., 1979, AJE">Moser et al., AJE, 1979</a>).
In the context of our NPI study where index cases were recruited within 48
hours of symptom onset, these findings
suggest that our NPI study design may lead to an underestimate of the true
effectiveness of the interventions because
some infections may have occurred prior to recruitment and intervention.
Nevertheless, provided that interventions
can be applied soon after symptom onset, it is likely that in our NPI study
we would be able to observe attenuated 
efficacies, and this should be taken into consideration when interpreting
the results.</p>

<h3><a name="quickvue">5. Rapid test sensitivity</a></h3>

<p>We examined the performance of the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, which we used
in our study to screen subjects.
The results are published in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.diagmicrobio.2009.05.003"
title="full text of Cheng et al., 2009, DMID">Cheng et al. (2009, Diagnostic
Microbiology and Infectious Disease)</a>.
We studied the sensitivity and specificity of the rapid test
versus viral culture as the gold standard. We found moderate overall sensitivity of around 68% and
high specificity of around 96%.</p>

<p>We also tested a subset of specimens by quantitative RT-PCR and found that test
sensitivity increases with viral load. We also found that viral loads were higher in children
and sooner after illness onset.</p>

<h3><a name="tamiflu">7. Direct and indirect benefits of oseltamivir treatment</a></h3>

<p>Almost 25% of index cases in our pilot and main studies were
prescribed oseltamivir treatment by their treating physician. We
studied the effectiveness of oseltamivir treatment in reducing
duration of illness and viral shedding, as well as the indirect
benefits in reducing transmission to household members. The
findings from our study are published in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/650458"
title="full text of Ng et al., 2010, CID">Ng et
al. (2010, CID)</a>. We found that oseltamivir treatment given within 24
hours reduced the duration of illness by around half
(statistically significant), and the risk of transmission to
household contacts by around half (not statistically significant).

<h3><a name="mot">10. Modes of transmission of influenza A virus in households</a></h3>

<p>Influenza A viruses are believed to spread between humans through contact, large respiratory droplets and small particle droplet nuclei (aerosols), 
but the relative importance of each of these modes of transmission is unclear. Cowling and colleagues modelled data of 822 subjects recruited from NPI study 2008-2009 to estimate that 
aerosol transmission accounts for approximately half of all influenza transmission events.</p>

<h3><a name="comment">A comment on reproducible research</a></h3>

<p>We fully support the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/EDE.0b013e318196784a">increasing calls</a>
from the academic community for 
<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwj093" title="Peng et al., 2006, AJE">epidemiologic analyses to be reproducible</a>,
and <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1745-6215-10-17" title="Hrynaszkiewicz and Altman, 2009, Trials">raw data from randomized controlled trials to be published</a>, as a part of the wider scientific endeavour to
replicate results.
Another example of this recommendation is in the <a
href="http://www.qve-goodpracticeguide.org.uk/guide#TOC-2.4-Inputs">Good
Practice Guide for Quantitative Veterinary Epidemiology</a>. 
Here we have published the raw <em>anonymised</em> data from our HK NPI
pilot study, and will later release the data from our main study. We have also published
scripts which allow the analyses in our published papers to be reproduced.</p>

<p>Thousands of local people have given their time, and their families', as part of their
participation in our studies,
all in the expectation that our research studies will add to medical and scientific knowledge.
Participants should also expect that we will make the best possible use of the information that
we have collected about them. It would be difficult to argue that facilitating
best use of the data by the research community need not involve releasing raw data.</p>

<p>Publication of anonymised raw data has been approved by our local IRB and funding sources,
and participants were advised that anonymised data would be published during the informed consent
process. We anticipate that release of the raw data will:</p>
<ul class="circle">
 <li>Promote reproducibility of our results.
 <li>Allow other investigators to conduct their own analyses on our data.
 <li>Allow other investigators to compare our data with theirs, for
   example to explore similarities and differences between research findings.
 <li>Allow other investigators to prepare and plan for their own studies.
